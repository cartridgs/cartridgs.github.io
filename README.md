	<p2>June 6, 1944</p2>


	<p> This invasion, planned by the Allied Powers, was to attack the Normandy coast of France. For a long time, the Allied powers wanted to regain foothold in France again ever since British retreat from France in 1940. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December of 1941, the US formally agreed to work with Britain. From there along with other Allied powers, began planning for the one of the biggest invasions in history which would become known as D-Day.</p>

	<p>This attack took careful planning and a long time of gathering up resources. After several military campaigns from 1942 to 1943, they got a rough outline on where to launch their large scale military operation. For this operation to work, the combined strength and manpower of the Allied countries would be vital. Because British resources were being used up at a decently fast pace, the only other country that had a vast amount of resources at their disposal was the US. In result, the US appointed General Dwight D. Eisenhower as the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. After thorough consideration and planning, the COSSAC’s, the group tasked to plan the Invasion of D-Day, decided to attack somewhere along the English Channel. Since Germany had started to fortifying heavily Pas De Calais region, they ultimately chose the Normandy beaches as the place to attack. Normandy was a weak spot in the German defenses at the time and would give a good opportunity to penetrate further into Europe and pave a path directly to German territory to win the war. Originally, the plan was to attack the beaches of Normandy in three to five separate groups. In order for that plan to work, Eisenhower and his other general, Bernard Montgomery, advised to strengthen the military force that was to land on the beaches. This was so they could stretch their attack area in order to capture the port city of Cherbourg. This would stretch the attack area to about 60 miles of beaches and an incredible amount of resources.</p>

	<p>The overall plan of the attack involved much of the Air Force and Navy. The US airborne troops would parachute behind enemy lines to disrupt German efforts of trying to enforce the beach defenses. Then, a portion of the US infantry composed of the 1st and parts of the 29th Infantry devisions to attack on OMAHA Beach. Then, two army divisions of British command would attack GOLD and JUNO Beach. A third British division would would also be deployed at SWORD Beach. After the taking the beach, each division would go their separate routes to take over strategic parts of Europe.</p>

	<p>The day before the attack, the weather on the English Channel turned stormy, Eisenhower pushed back the invasion date from June 5 to June 6. On June 6, he order the go ahead of this large scale operation. He predicted that a large portion of the airborne soldiers would be killed in action so before the soldiers took off, he met with those parachuters to say a word of goodbye to them. The night before the landings of the infantry, the airborne units dropped near the zones they were assigned. But because of stormy weather, some pilots weren’t able to see the drop zones and others missed it by a large amount. This resulted in a lot of airborne units being scattered in enemy territory. But because of this chaos and confusion of the paratroopers landings, the German military headquarters were quite confused. Since the parachuters were all over the place, the Germans couldn’t quite get a hold of the meaning of it. </p>

	<p>The next morning at 5:30 am, the navy bombarded the beaches of Normandy to clear land mines and other obstructions on the beach. The bombardment ended on scheduled but the landing crafts scheduled to land right after the bombardment ran late. Since Germans were given a brief amount of time, they were able to regain some balance before the arrival of Allied infantry. Once they landed, the Allied infantry were met with heavy German gunfire along all the beaches. Though they were met with difficulties at the start, some divisions were able to move inland. Though everything was running pretty close to the schedule, things at OMAHA were in a dire situation. Strong winds made the waves extremely choppy and had taken a few landing crafts down. Those who survived arrived at the beach with severe sea sickness which lowered the effectiveness of the attack. The strong winds also push a large portion of the landing crafts away from their landing points. They were pushed out of range of naval support and the commanding officer’s maps were useless. Bombing planes that were scheduled to drop bombs on the beach to soften the defenses, missed their location up to 3 miles. On the beach, there were many concert slabs and others that got in the way of the invasion. Bulldozers that were meant to clear the path were destroyed by enemy fire with only 3 of the 16 bulldozers surviving. Of those 3, one was not able to maneuver because of the soldiers hiding behind the slabs. So because all of this, the bulldozers were only able to open 6 gaps where the succeeding landing crafts would eventually pile men into. But as time went on, the landing crafts kept on adding momentum to the push toward the German line. At one point, there was even about 34,000 soldiers on that particular section of the beach with an enormous amount of equipment. Slowly but surely, the soldiers at OMAHA took over that section of the beachhead.</p>

	<p>As noon came around on the second day, June 6, 1944, most of Normandy’s beach’s had already taken over. More than 100,000 soldiers had landed on those beaches in that short amount of time.</p>
